# 🛫 The Mostly Harmless Guide to the Homelab

> “In the beginning, the Homelab was created. This has made a lot of people very excited and been widely regarded as a good move.”

Welcome, curious traveler, to the **Homelab Modular Infrastructure Stack** — a mostly harmless attempt to organize chaos into containers, tame your data, and perhaps, eventually, understand where all your RAM went.

This is not your average homelab. This is a **multi-stack hyperservice galactic core simulator**, suitable for developers, sysadmins, secret AI experiments, and sentient toasters with an interest in observability.

## 🌌 Orientation: Welcome Aboard the Chaos

This repository contains a loosely allied federation of containers. Each stack operates in its own little sector of the universe (or file tree), blissfully unaware of the entropy it's helping prevent. Or create. It’s hard to say.

What you will *not* find here (yet):

- A full tutorial
- An install script
- A sensible approach to minimalism

What you *will* find:

- Modular Docker Compose setups
- Opinionated stack naming conventions (that sound like sci-fi bridge commands)
- Commentary that only slightly helps

## 🧰 Core Infrastructure Subsystems

### 🧰 `engineering-deck`

🛠 Development tools for mortals: CodeServer, Hoppscotch, and other noble attempts at productivity.

### 🧪 `data-core`

📦 A containment grid for your stateful sins: PostgreSQL, Redis, Qdrant, and other creatures of the deep.

> 🗏 **NOTE**: Some services will phone home to this stack when they get lonely for a database. Keep it running, or things will start sulking in logs.

### 🚱 `sensor-array`

📈 Monitoring, metrics, and possibly a few metaphysical inquiries into uptime.

### 🛡 `shield-array`

🔀 Ingress, auth, and the reverse proxy wizardry of Traefik. Also watches for solar flares (metaphorically).

### 🤖 `drone-bay`

🧠 Experimental AI services. No guarantee they won't develop opinions about your code.

### 🎮 `holo-deck`

💼 Media automation: Plex, Sonarr, Radarr, and friends. Your entertainment stack — or at least something to debug *while* watching a movie.

### 📦 `cargo-hold`

🔐 Storage, secrets, and the digital equivalent of "that drawer" everyone has. Includes MinIO, Infisical, FileGator, and more.

### 🧹 `maintenance-bay`

🕰 Automated backups, updates, and the digital custodianship of Watchtower and Duplicati.

### 👩‍🚀 `crew-deck`

🔑 Dashboards, bookmarks, and UI tools to remember what you deployed three weeks ago.

### 🏠 `captains-quarters`

🛏 Home automation: Home Assistant, Frigate, and the uncanny feeling your coffee maker might be logging motion events.

## ⚛️ Philosophy of the Stack

- **Everything is a stack.** If you can docker-compose it, you can name it dramatically.
- **Nothing is permanent.** Except maybe that one volume you forgot to mount.
- **Documentation is important.** So I wrote this instead.

---

## 🚀 Launch Your Own Expedition

Until automation scripts arrive from hyperspace, deploying these stacks is a manual process. But remember, half the journey is understanding which `.env` file you forgot to rename.

Each stack includes:

- A `docker-compose.yml` file with carefully arranged YAML incantations
- A `.env.example` file to serve as both guide and warning
- A `README.md` in most stacks that may or may not tell the truth

## 🎓 Learning Nothing at All (FAQ)

**Q: Is this production-ready?**\
A: If you squint.

**Q: Why is everything named like Star Trek meets Douglas Adams?**\
A: Because I *can*.

**Q: Can I contribute?**\
A: Yes, especially if your stack has a ridiculous name and borderline irresponsible ambition.

**Q: Does it scale?**\
A: Emotionally? No. Horizontally? Sure, if you believe in yourself.

## ✨ Final Notes

Remember: the goal of this project is to inspire, experiment, and maintain just enough order to keep the Prometheus metrics flowing and the AI from achieving sentience.



So deploy boldly, explore carelessly, and above all: **Don’t Panic.**
